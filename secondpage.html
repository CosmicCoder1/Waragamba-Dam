  <h3>
    Even though the dam is at full capacity, only 25% of Warragamba Dam’s water is said to be safe to drink. Experts from Sydney Water say that the shortage of safe, clean drinking water has been caused because of the floods last year which has caused lots of pressure on the dam’s filtration system. During the peak of the floods, only 5%-10% of the water was suitable for treatment and filtering. Since then it has risen to 25%. Water usage has also increased, before it used to be 64 litres a day now it’s 69 litres a day.

  <h3>
Experts are saying that residents must conserve water or else water restrictions will have to be made. 
The people of the Warragamba catchment will be affected in many ways. 
There won’t be enough clean water to use to grow crops. As plants require water to perform photosynthesis, plants won’t be able to produce enough food for themselves to grow  causing lack of domestic food production. If there isn’t enough food production, not everyone will get enough food. 
The lack of water will also affect us in our day-to-day lives. We won’t have enough water coming from our taps. There won’t be enough water to water the plants. This will cause a lot of plants to dry out. 
The government will have to place restrictions on recreational activities, meaning that most pools and places that rely on water will have to close or use limited water. 
Other than ourselves, the water shortages will affect plants and animals. Farm animals or even wild animals will have no water to drink or use and the amount of them will decrease. This will threaten extinction to the animals.   
This list can keep going. We need to find different ways to ensure that everyone gets water.
